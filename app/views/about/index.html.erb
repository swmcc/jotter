      <div class="prose prose-gray max-w-none">
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Jotter is a personal project by <%= link_to "Stephen McCullough (swmcc)", "https://swmcc.github.io", class: "text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline", target: "_blank", rel: "noopener" %>.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4 mt-8">Bookmarks</h3>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          I built this as a way to keep interesting bookmarks on my own server, where I own the data and don't have to rely on third-party apps. Remember <%= link_to "Delicious", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delicious_(website)", class: "text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline", target: "_blank", rel: "noopener" %>? It was brilliant until Yahoo bought it and it eventually disappeared, taking everyone's carefully curated bookmarks with it. Never again.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-8">
          With Jotter, my bookmarks live on my own infrastructure. They're mine, they're private (unless I choose to share them), and they'll be here as long as I want them to be.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4 mt-8">Images</h3>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Same story with images. <%= link_to "Twitpic", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitpic", class: "text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline", target: "_blank", rel: "noopener" %> shut down in 2014 and took millions of photos with it. Photobucket started charging people to access their own images. I'm tired of trusting other people's servers with my stuff.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-8">
          Now my photos are here, on my own infrastructure. They'll be around as long as I am.
